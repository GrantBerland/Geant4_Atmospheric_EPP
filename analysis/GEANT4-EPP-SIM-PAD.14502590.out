*** G4Exception : Transport-001-ExcessSteps

 =============== Recommendations / advice ====================
 Recommendations to address this issue (Transport-001-ExcessSteps)
 This warning is controlled by the SetThresholdWarningEnergy  method of G4Transportation.  
 Current value of 'warning' threshold= 0 MeV 
 - If 'unimportant' particles (with energy low enough not to matter in your   application, then increase its value. 
 - If particles of high-enough energy to be important are being  killed, you can 
   a) Increase the trial steps using the method  SetThresholdTrials().    Particles above the 'important' threshold 
  will be given this many 'chances'.  The default value was 10, and the current value is 300
   b) Increase the energy which you consider 'important' (above this they are killed only after extra trials), using the method SetThresholdImportantEnergy() 
      Note: this can incur a potentially high cost in extra simulation time  if more tracks require very large number of integration steps . 
   c) investigate alternative integration methods 
    e.g.  Helical methods for uniform or almost uniform fields or else higher order RK methods such as DormandPrince78
